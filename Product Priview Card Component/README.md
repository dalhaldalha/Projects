### Built with

- HTML
- CSS FLexbox
- Media Query

### What I learned

- I learned about Css Resets.
- There should only be one H1 element on a page, for  SEO I assume.
- Learned that it is best practice to start of your design with a mobile version first and then scale it up.
- Call to actions(CTAs) should be anchors instead of buttons.
- Create Landmarks for different parts of the website.


### Continued development

I need more practice with harder projects in the future.
